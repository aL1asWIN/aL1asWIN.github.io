## Summary

I built a recommendation system that helps travelers plan their itinerary. Recommender Systems are a part of everyday life. I wanted to be able to go through the steps of understanding and building one myself.

This system allows a user to input their preferences into the data to make recommendations based off of what they inputted.

How can we apply recommendations to help travelers plan, whether it be fore restaurants, places, activities and more.

__Data__

The data was scraped from Trip by Skyscanner, which is a website that travelers can post their reviews and recommendations on hotels, restaurants and activities.
I focused on Austin, Tx and pulled the top 200 usernames from the leaderboards which resulted in over 5000 reviews.

used was Kanye West lyrics across his entire discography. I wanted to determine if there were consistent groups that can be identified and if these changed over time. Significant time was spent in collecting each song and cleaning the text of each song into a usable corpus. Tasks include removing stop words, lemmatization, and lyric attribute removal using regex.

__Takeaway__

Overall I haven’t quite solved how to beat traditional ways to research travelling preparation.
However, I believe this recommender system has great application and viable use. 
This is a simple baseline recommender system that has the potential to build upon into the future.
